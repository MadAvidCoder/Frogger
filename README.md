# Infinite Frogger
### Play it [here](https://madavidcoder.github.io/Frogger)!
An endless runner remix of the classic arcade game Frogger. How far can you guide the frog safely over roads and rivers?

## Play üéÆ
Head to [https://madavidcoder.github.io/Frogger](https://madavidcoder.github.io/Frogger) to play.

Use WASD or Arrow Keys to control your character. Cross the roads and rivers, but don't get hit by cars or fall in the water. Watch out for rotten logs, which will break under your weight. Collect food to get a higher score and keep moving, or the bottom of the screen will catch up to you.

Earn coins for your scores, and spend them on new playable characters. Save your progress to an account and challenge yourself to see how far you can go! Can you top the global leaderboard?
